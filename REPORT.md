## ABSTRACT

This project delivers a fully offline Streamlit experience that expands a traditional binary IMDB sentiment task into a seven-in-one analytical assistant suitable for classroom demos and rapid prototyping. A custom heuristic pipeline built on VADER sentiment analysis, curated topic and emotion dictionaries, and lightweight text utilities generates multi-class sentiment labels, topical focus, sentiment-preserving summaries, emotion intensity scores, key sentence extraction, keyword clouds, rating projections, and audience suitability guidance without relying on large hosted language models. To ensure deterministic behavior on Streamlit Cloud, we replaced transformer downloads with local logic, tuned hyperparameters for CPU-only execution, and added rating-band messaging so every predicted score maps to a clear viewing recommendation. The bundled dataset now contains fifty curated English reviews spanning playful comedies, moody dramas, horror shorts, and genre hybrids, each tagged with sentiment, topic, and rating metadata. These entries power the sidebar tools: users can filter by sentiment or rating range, preview any sample, trigger random loads, download the JSONL file, or press quick-pick buttons that instantly populate the textarea. An Altair visualization, clearly titled “內建影評資料圖,” keeps the corpus transparent by summarizing the label distribution with interactive tooltips. The interface maintains textarea state, exposes sliders for keyword counts and sensitivity, and surfaces load failures gracefully, making it easy to iterate on heuristics or extend the keyword dictionaries stored in `model/heuristics.json`. The repository documents setup requirements (Python 3.11, CPU-friendly wheels) and adds a concise `REPORT.md` abstract so collaborators understand the educational intent, architecture, and limitations at a glance. Overall, the system shows how carefully engineered heuristics, well-scoped datasets, and thoughtful UX affordances can approximate richer IMDB analyses without heavyweight models, offering a reproducible template for AIOT coursework, hackathons, or rapid experimentation that must run reliably within tight resource envelopes.
